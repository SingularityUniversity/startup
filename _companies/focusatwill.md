## About

The company started two years ago when founders Will Henshall and John Vitale became interested in why people like to listen to music when they read. They found that listening to music while reading is not generally done for entertainment purposes, but is often used as a tool to help mask distraction and assist focus. Further research showed two out of three of people like to listen to music while they work, study or read but it’s difficult to find and manage music that consistently works well for this purpose. So we created a new unique neuroscience based web service that helps increase your focus by “zoning out” distractions.
