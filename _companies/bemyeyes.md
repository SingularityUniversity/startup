## About

Be My Eyes is an app that connects blind and visually impaired people with volunteer helpers from 145 countries around the world via live video chat.

## Problem

For a visually impaired person, small domestic tasks are often big challenges. Be My Eyes is changing that by making life easier for people with visual impairment by linking them to volunteer helpers around the world. 

## Breakthrough

Be My Eyes is the first app which allows people with a visual impairment to get in contact with sighted helpers via a direct video call. The system is built as a shuffle-call system that forwards the call to a global helper network until answered. Be My Eyes is now the largest global network of blind and visually impaired people in the world. 

## Why Does It Matter?

There are more than 250 million blind and visually impaired people in the world. Most lack independence and aren't realising their full potential due to a lack of sight. Be My Eyes wants to change that by 'crowd sourcing eyes' on demand.
