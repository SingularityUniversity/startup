## About

Robotics today is a fast growing industry with applications in myriad markets, including retail, transportation, manufacturing, and even as personal assistants. Fellow Robots is at the forefront of reimagining these uses for the best retail experience – to improve your experience when shopping and to help employees with the most up to date information on inventory and location of goods and services.

## Problem

The model for delivering customer service in retail stores has remained largely unchanged for the last few decades. With the influence from e-commerce, nowadays brick and mortar customers are expecting instant search, personalized service, easy access to extensive knowledge, etc, that can’t be provided by the traditional model.

## Breakthrough

The future of shopping is here and its name is OSHbot. Fellow Robots is reimagining retail robotics to create a smarter retail environment. OSHbot communicates with shoppers to identify what they need and then autonomously navigates through the store to provide easy and a rapid selection to selected items. This creates smarter shoppers and a more efficient shopping experience.
