## About

We are improving processed food to make it nutritious, delicious and affordable. We are leveraging fruit waste as a source for nutrients and creating ingredients that save on production costs for manufacturers while also improving the nutritional value of their products. 

## Problem

One out of three kids in Mexico are obese, mostly due to the food offering they have at hand; products with high contents of sugar, fats and sugar. Food manufacturers work in low margins, having to either select creating nutritional products at a high cost, or junk food at an affordable price.

## Breakthrough

We created a technological platform that takes fruit residues as an input, mainly seeds and peels, make their nutrients available and transform them into ingredients for the food manufacturing industry. Our ingredients can create operational savings and improve nutrition of existing products. 

## Why Does It Matter?

We are not changing a habit, we are changing what the offering. We leverage existing food manufacturing infrastructure and improve the nutritional value of their products offered to existing customers, so that their wide distribution channels multiply that impact.
