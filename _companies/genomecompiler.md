## About

Genome Compiler is a leader in the Synthetic Biology computer assisted design (CAD) space. Genome Complier delivers an innovative platform-as-a-service for researchers in Academia and Industry. Genome Compiler’s platform merges a best-in-kind CAD tool and a marketplace for both bits (Bio-informatics services, genetic repositories access) and atoms (DNA synthesis, biofab services). Our vision is to democratize the tools of creation, unleashing innovation in biotechnology that will enable a more sustainable future.

## Problem

The complexity of designing biological applications is staggering. With the exponential reduction in price performance of both reading and writing DNA (Sequencing and Synthesis) our abilities grows faster then ever before. We need CAD tools to manage the complexity of biology and enable to forward engineering of biology.

## Breakthrough

CAD – computer assisted design – enables dramatic improvement in huge industries ranging from chip design to mechanical design. Biology is the most advanced and the most complicated technology on Earth. Managing the complexity of biology in software to enable the forward engineering of biology is the true “moonshot” mission of Genome Compiler.
