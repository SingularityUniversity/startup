## About

Be-novative creates a synergy of ideas within multinational corporations and between self-organizing communities using behavioral science, gamification and social mechanics where the collective intelligence can be harnessed in order to motivate each other, be transparent on the goals and continuously track individual and collective progress. With be-novative cloud-based software and mobile app in self-organizing, collaborative and diverse brainstorming teams, people share ideas, compete with each other developing products or methods in a playful way. Be-novative won the Global Impact Competiton of Singularity University in Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe in 2012 and thus, the CEO-cofounder Priszcilla Varnagy participated in GSP12.
