## About

Silk Biomaterials is a tissue engineering technology platform company. It is currently developing the first fibroin-made tissue engineered graft for vascular procedures (i.e.: artery bypass, peripheral revascularization, etc.). However, the long-term objective is to create a solid technology platform for regenerative medicine and other specific procedures (peripheral nerves and ligaments reconstruction, dura mater, skin repair, etc.). We leverage the biomimetic properties and the mechanical advantages of silk. We use a unique technology that represents a breakthrough innovation in the manufacturing of silk fibroin tissue engineered medical devices.
