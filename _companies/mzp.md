## About

Is it possible to diagnose medical conditions related to the cardiovascular system using a single drop of blood? To answer that question, and as a request from neonatologists and hematologists, we have developed the blood microviscometer: a medical device that analyzes a single drop of blood in just a few minutes. The device consists of a portable embedded sensing system and a disposable micromachined chip where the drop is placed and the analysis automatically takes place. Our novel disposable chip design allows a quick setup with no need of calibration and easy replacement in order to perform consecutive measurements. This device could radically affect the diagnosis of medical conditions related to the cardiovascular system, blood clotting problems, and hyperviscosity related diseases. Our technology enables the use of blood viscosity measurements for the screening and diagnosis of high incidence, flow related medical conditions in adults and newborns such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke and neonatal hyperviscosity syndrome. Unlike complex laboratory viscometer systems, our microviscometer is a portable, low cost, easy to use Point of Care device to be used in hospitals and medical facilities, for both emergency situations and routine checks. This device covers an unsatisfied need in medical care, as while there are viscometers used in oil and paint industries, there are no commercial available systems for clinical purposes.

## Problem

Performing fluid tests, such as viscosity measurements, using a single drop of sample and with low-cost, portable and automated devices.

## Breakthrough

Enabling the use of blood viscosity measurements in routine clinical practice, for the screening and diagnosis of high incidence, flow related medical conditions in adults and newborns.

## Why Does It Matter?

It will improve the early detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in the world.
It will bring clinical analysis to the doctor's office, and even to the patient's home, allowing easier, cheaper and faster results.
