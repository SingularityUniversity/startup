## About

We use discarded electric car batteries to provide free electricity to communities in the developing world. 

## Problem

Can you imagine going into a room full of toxic lead acid batteries for electricity everyday? Unfortunately 1.5 billion people in the developing world do. Lack of reliable electricity makes using toxic lead acid batteries mandatory. We have a better solution. 

## Breakthrough

Our backpack sized Li-Ion battery pack can replace a room full of toxic lead acid batteries for a fraction of the cost. We capture the residual value of used electric vehicle batteries to make this possible. By charging via solar panels we provide access and reliable 24X7 electricity where it is badly needed.

## Why Does It Matter?

$5 billion worth of toxic lead acid batteries attempt to cater the power needs of the developing world while failing spectacularly. With our for-profit waste to use model we can solve this need while creating a sustainable impact.
