## About

Network Society Research creates a vision and analytical tools to allow individuals, enterprises and the society at large to deal positively with the unstoppable change towards the decentralization of socio-economic activities. 

## Problem

A set of simultaneous technologies is growing exponentially, with the common feature of being decentralized, and organized in a network, contrasting with the centralized and hierarchical organizations. The shift to the new structure subjects the Nation State to an unprecedented pressure. 

## Breakthrough

Using Internet of Things, AI, and Blockchain technologies, we empower communities to measure their Network Society Readiness index, and act to adopt best practices to implement empowering exponential technologies. 

## Why Does It Matter?

The speed of technological change is accelerating, and the capacity of regulatory bodies to debate, decide, implement, measure and update their policies must keep pace with the transformation and novel needs of society worldwide.
