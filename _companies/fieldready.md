## About

We do direct relief work in the field, bringing engineers, designers and humanitarians with digital manufacturing equipment to help local people and relief workers make solutions to their most pressing problems. Then we amplify this using the network effects of digital manufacturing, connecting people, and sharing information. Field Ready will reach global scale through partnership with aid agencies and NGOs, helping them innovate by showing what is possible with new technologies. Our aim is to make aid more effective and more efficient, so that people after disasters and in other humanitarian crises have quick access to key supplies they need to survive and thrive.

## Problem

Humanitarian supply chains.

## Breakthrough

Field Ready is pioneering an approach to humanitarian logistics that uses technology, innovative design and engaging people in new ways.  

## Why Does It Matter?

Each year as many as 300 million people are affected by disasters and many more suffer from problems that can be addressed by local manufacturing.  Transforming humanitarian logistics will not only have a deep impact on the delivery of aid but also assist people in new and profound ways.
