## About

We do direct relief work in the field, bringing engineers, designers and humanitarians with digital manufacturing equipment to help local people and relief workers make solutions to their most pressing problems. Then we amplify this using the network effects of digital manufacturing, connecting people, and sharing information. Field Ready will reach global scale through partnership with aid agencies and NGOs, helping them innovate by showing what is possible with new technologies. Our aim is to make aid more effective and more efficient, so that people after disasters and in other humanitarian crises have quick access to key supplies they need to survive and thrive.
