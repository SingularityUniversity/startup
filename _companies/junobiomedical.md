## About

 Juno Biomedical Inc. is developing a medical device to restore function and improve quality of life after an ischemic stroke. Our Stroke Treatment Kit, CELLTech™, is a digitized and personalized in-home, neuromodulation therapy that has the ability to repair damaged brain tissue after stroke, not just treat the symptoms. CELLTech™ is designed to harness and amplify the body's most powerful fundamental process of tissue repair. At Juno Biomedical, our goal is to help evolve current medicine to become more patient-centric than ever before in history, and to accomplish this by integrating exponential technologies such as digital patient monitoring, bioelectric therapy, and tissue regeneration into our products. We believe that survivors of stroke should be provided medical options that allow them to regain functioning, independence and personal freedom even after a devastating stroke event.

## Problem

One billion people worldwide suffer from a stroke event, brain trauma, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or other neurological impairment and are often left with no medical options. We are initially repairing neurological damage in patients who have suffered severe impairment after an ischemic stroke.


## Breakthrough

CELLTech™ is a patented technology based on 20+ years of research that has the potential to reverse neurological impairment after stroke. If successful in human stroke trials, CELLTech™ will serve as a model to bring hope and improved quality of life to up to 1 billon people globally.

## Why Does It Matter?

The current medical practices are focused on treatment rather than repair. Juno Biomedical’s technology will impact the medical industry in an unprecedented way, redefining the way world thinks about medical practice as a whole. Once CELLTech™ is FDA approved, the longevity and quality of life impact on humanity will be exponential.
