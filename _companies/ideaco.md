## About

IDEAco is a non-profit organization on a mission to build and empower global communities of changemakers through experiential learning.

## Problem

Today’s education system doesn’t prepare students to be globally active problem solvers for the challenges they’ll face in their futures.

## Breakthrough

By using a human-centered design approach and focusing on technologies as tools for change, we build educational programs and experiences that emphasize real-world application and impact.

## Why Does It Matter?

By creating experiences that make exponential technologies and big ideas accessible and tangible for a wide audience, we are preparing a generation of capable and thoughtful changemakers that can tackle the global challenges we face as a society. There’s lots to fix, and we need people who can do it.
