## About

Getaround, a car sharing marketplace where individuals can offer their own cars for rent, started as a Energy Team Project in the inaugural Graduate Studies Program of 2009 – anticipating the advent of robotic cars. As TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2011 Winners, Getaround aims at matching urban dwellers without cars and car owners looking to make some extra cash. In addition to changing legislation in two states to make it easier for car-owners to share their cars, Getaround is now the largest peer-to-peer car sharing service in the space. They provide insurance, 24 hour roadside assistance, a car-kit, an iPhone and Web app (which lets you conveniently locate, access, and unlock the car you’re renting without ever having to see its owner).
