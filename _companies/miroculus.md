## About

Miroculus is a biotech company that brings an accurate, easy to use, non-invasive and affordable microRNA detection platform that radically improves the ability of Life Science Research and Healthcare providers to diagnose and treat disease.

## Problem

One out of three people will eventually be diagnosed with some type of cancer, about 8 million people die of cancer every year worldwide. The death toll could rise about 80% by 2030, according to the World Health Organization. Low- to middle-income countries may get hit the hardest. Today, cancer detection and staging mostly happens after manifestation of symptoms which is simply too late.

## Breakthrough

We are developing the world most accessible, easy to use and accurate platform for microRNAs detection in the bloodstream allowing doctors to provide a single cancer test, non-invasive, accurate, accessible and fast. Since we are looking for patterns, you donâ€™t need to know which cancer you are looking for, even if the patient is not presenting symptoms yet.

## Why Does It Matter?

We believe the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against cancer is early detection which is why mirOculus proposes a novel diagnostic approach which screens for many cancers, with one single, non-invasive and affordable test.
