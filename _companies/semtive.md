## About

Semtive is a clean energy development company. We developed an innovative wind turbine for both urban and rural applications. Simple, reliable, cheap and efficient. 

## Problem

Many ways to generate energy are not environmentally friendly. Conventional renewable sources are unreliable and not cost efficient. Lack of infrastructure and high maintenance costs are a constant for future development.

## Breakthrough

Our turbines allow people to generate clean energy in an easy way. Reliable, using duty design, and virtually maintenance free. Our manufacturing process allows us to produce a low cost turbine with access to on-grid and off-grid markets while providing energy on a cost efficient basis to everyone.

## Why Does It Matter?

Everyone needs energy. It is essential for future development and necessary to do so reliably and at low cost. The increasing costs of conventional energy and large environmental impacts are problems that must be solved for future generations.
