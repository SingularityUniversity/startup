## About

Calorie Cloud is a technology platform that leverages wearable tech, web, and mobile apps to capture the abundance of calories burned here in US into life saving food for undernourished kids. We have explored programs for a variety of markets and are currently focusing on two areas: Workplace Wellness Challenges and the UNICEF Kid Power Program.

## Problem

1 in 3 adults in the US are considered obese according to the National Institutes of Health.
1 in 4 kids across the developing world are malnourished.  This is the #1 root cause of under 5 year old child deaths adding up to 3 millions lives lost every year.

## Breakthrough

Calorie Cloud is connecting health activity and malnutrition in a new way that helps solve two global health issues at once.  

## Why Does It Matter?

Our actions to become more active and healthy directly help severely malnourished children survive and thrive.
