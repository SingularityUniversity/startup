## About

X2AI uses AI to connect the patient with their therapist 24/7. Tess, X2AI's emotion-based conversation AI, interacts with the patient by administering therapy and providing mental health education through a variety of existing technology-based communications, including SMS, WhatsApp and web browsers.

## Problem

Many patients don’t have access to timely, quality mental healthcare services when they need it, and for many, the cost of accessing such care is prohibitive. Also, many mental healthcare professionals have limited capacity in treating patients. 

## Breakthrough

Emotion is the core of Tess. She forms a bond with the patient and personalizes their experience based on their emotion. Tess is programmed to each mental health professional’s therapy, treatment and education approach. Tess is scaleable, without the need for additional hardware or software. 

## Why Does It Matter?

Today, mental illness affects one in four people at some point during their lives, and is often ignored and stigmatized. Mental health professionals have limited capacity in treating patients, and, in developing countries, mental healthcare services are practically nonexistent.
