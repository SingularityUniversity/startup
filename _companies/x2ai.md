## About

X2AI builds Tess, a psychological AI that administers highly personalized psychotherapy, psycho-education, and health-related reminders, on-demand, when and where the mental health professional isn’t. Interaction with Tess is solely through conversation, exclusively via existing communication channels, such as SMS, Facebook Messenger, Web Browsers, and several other platforms.

## Problem

Many patients don’t have access to timely, quality mental healthcare services when they need it, and for many, the cost of accessing such care is prohibitive. Also, many mental healthcare professionals have limited capacity in treating patients. 

## Breakthrough

Emotion is the core of Tess. She forms a bond with the patient and personalizes their experience based on their emotion. Each mental health professional’s therapy, treatment and education approach can be encoded into Tess, creating a digitally uploaded version of the mental health professional. Tess is scalable, without the need for additional hardware or software.

## Why Does It Matter?

Today, mental illness affects one in four people at some point during their lives, and is often ignored and stigmatized. Mental health professionals have limited capacity in treating patients, and, in developing countries, mental healthcare services are practically nonexistent.
