## About

We are building a software tool which will use hyperspectral data and provide information about the quality and characteristics of different foods using machine learning algorithms. This has the potential to revolutionise the food system by providing access to information far beyond what our human eyes can see.

## Problem

1/3 of food produced every year gets wasted, equaling around 1.2 - 2 billion tons, at the same time almost 1 billion people are hungry worldwide. Additionally, food fraud costs the global economy upwards of $40 billion each year. We want to reduce these current tragic levels of waste and loss.

## Breakthrough

We are building the ImpactVision Cloud (the first generalised hyperspectral Cloud services) and vision-as-a-service software, which will give us information far beyond what human eyes can see. This knowledge will be invaluable for determining food quality attributes and optimising supply chains.

## Why Does It Matter?

We are looking into the future and building services for when hyperspectral sensors will be ubiquitous and artificial-intelligence enhanced Cloud-based computing and storage will be accessible to billions. Soon, people and businesses will have access to a whole new world of information which will be used to make the global food system transparent, secure and optimised.
