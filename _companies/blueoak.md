## About

BlueOak Resources, a venture from SU’s 2010 Graduate Studies Program, recently won Harvard Business School’s second annual Alumni New Venture Contest. Their team is focused on building a pilot to demonstrate the extraction of valuable metals from discarded electronics. Using existing scaled-up mining industry technologies, they hope to capture value from the 40 million tons of “e-waste” that is landfilled or incinerated annually around the world, containing 70 billion dollars worth of precious and base metals. BlueOak Resources addresses the fundamental issue of mining instead of recycling “accelerating waste” in a world of exponential technologies and exponential obsolescence.
