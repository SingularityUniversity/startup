## About

Matternet is building a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to transport goods in places with inefficient or non-existent road infrastructure. Matternet uses small, electric UAVs to transport packages weighing up to 2 kilos for courier transportation in congested cities; and vaccine, medicine or other critical goods transportation in the developing world. By creating a new paradigm for transportation that leapfrogs roads, Matternet is helping to revolutionize transportation in both the developed and developing world.
