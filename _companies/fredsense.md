## About

We build biosensors to detect chemicals in our environment. 

## Problem

Knowing what is in our water is expensive, time consuming, and requires intense training. We simplify this process. 

## Breakthrough

We engineer microorganisms to turn them into electrochemical sensors and build hardware solutions for use in the field. 

## Why Does It Matter?

Knowing what is in your water is critical to ensuring the world's water supply. We empower people and companies to make sensing easy.
