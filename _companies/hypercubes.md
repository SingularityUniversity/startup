## About

We are a space company leveraging advances in remote sensing technology to provide a whole new level of Earth observation. 

## Problem

We lack the information necessary to optimally manage global resources to support a sustainable population growth. 

## Breakthrough

Satellites capable of unprecedented levels of information and details at a thousandth the cost of current satellites. 

## Why Does It Matter?

It's estimated that by 2050 the world population will reach the incredible mark of 9.6 billion people. We need to design a sustainable path.
