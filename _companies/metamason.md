## About

Metamason is building a healthcare-focused software platform that takes scanned images of the body and creates custom-fit, 3D-printed products that are truly personalized. Our flagship product is Respere, a custom 3D printed CPAP mask, designed to revolutionize treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea. 

## Problem

Conventional, mass-produced CPAP masks often fit poorly; they are unattractive, uncomfortable, noisy and prone to leakage mitigated with painfully tightened straps. For the millions of Americans currently suffering from OSA, an ineffective mask makes a good night's sleep all but impossible. 

## Breakthrough

Metamasonâ€™s key innovation is our software platform: a scalable process for automating the production of on-demand products unique to each person's individual physiology. 

## Why Does It Matter?

Recent advances in 3D Scanning, Algorithmic Design, and Additive Manufacturing have made a world of new products possible.
We started metamason to harness these new powers in the service of a wider mission: to improve the lives of people who suffer needlessly at the hands of outmoded design.
