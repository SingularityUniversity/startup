## About

Metamason, is a LA based medtech startup building the Scan-Fit-Print software platform for truly unique soft-elastic products, custom fit to the body via 3D printing & scanning. Our first product line, Respere is the world's first truly personalized CPAP mask for the treatment of sleep apnea. 

## Problem

Sleep apnea affects nearly 1 in 5 adult Americans. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the industry standard treatment. However, over 50% of CPAP users quit treatment in the first year, with poor mask ergonomics sighted as the leading issue. 

## Breakthrough

Metamason has invented a number of methods to 3D print platinum-cure medical grade silicone; combining this with a scan-to-fit platform to apply parametric designs to human topology is the perfect tool for proliferating useful and functional 3D printed medical devices. 

## Why Does It Matter?

Those who suffer from OSA but are non-compliant with treatment, have higher mortality rates than 2-pack-a-day smokers. Respere will increase compliance by fixing the ergonomic issue; improving quality of life of millions, while reducing the net burden on the health care system.
