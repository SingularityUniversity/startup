## About

Authentise helps companies to get their designs ready to be 3D printed. Our technology optimize designs and securely stream them directly to printers, monitoring production and ensuring its quality. Streaming is the cornerstone to unlocking the full potential for 3D printing. Pushing services into the cloud provides greater speed, interoperability, security, SaaS businesses models, and access to data usually locked up in machines. The result is an enhanced user experience, improved print quality, and integration into mainstream business ecosystems. Authentise believes distributed manufacturing techniques can provide fully automated production of objects closer to the point of use.

## Problem

Disrupting Supply Chains – Authentise believes distributed manufacturing techniques can provide fully automated production of objects closer to the point of use. Imagine spare parts printed where they’re needed. It’s a real opportunity to disrupt supply chains – but it will not come to bear without the power of streaming.

## Breakthrough

Streaming is the cornerstone to unlocking the full potential for 3D printing. Pushing services into the cloud provides greater speed, interoperability, security, SaaS businesses models, and access to data usually locked up in machines. The result is an enhanced user experience, improved print quality, and integration into mainstream business ecosystems.

## Why Does It Matter?

IP Protection Ensures File Integrity – Intellectual property protection is not only about file sharing. It’s about design integrity and liability. “There are situations where a protected distribution chain can be really helpful. Think of a person that wants a verified replacement part for something that is broken. A person in that situation would want to know that the design they were getting was the real thing.” ~ Michael Weinberg, staff attorney of Public Knowledge
