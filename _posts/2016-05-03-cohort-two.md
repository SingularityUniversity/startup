title: The Singularity University Startup Accelerator Welcomes Cohort 2
---
The team at Singularity University’s SU Labs is proud to announce our second Accelerator class. After scouring the globe, reviewing hundreds of startups, interviewing scores and vetting dozens, we finalized a list of four companies for our second class.

1. **[Field Ready](http://www.fieldready.org/)** - 3D Printing humanitarian supplies (medical, infrastructural, etc.) in the field. Created by two founders with a wealth of foreign aid and engineering experience, the team has long standing projects in Haiti and Nepal and are opening a lab in Turkey to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis. 
2. **[Impact Vision](http://www.impactvi.com/)** -  Using hyperspectral imaging technology (cameras detecting multiple bands of color) to tackle the $1 trillion issue of food waste (1/3 of the global food supply). The technology provides much better quality control in  the food supply chain, from producer to retailer. The team is using  artificial intelligence to analyze food freshness and contaminants,  and is further evolving  to become a platform for hyperspectral data. 
3. **[Juno Biomedical](http://junobiomedical.com/)** - Using electro-regenerative technology for brain repair. Juno has developed a technology (Celltech) which can affect the neurological signal between cells in order to direct stem cells to damaged parts of the brain. The team is building on decades of research and has the backing and support of prominent neuroscientists. 
4. **[MZP Tech](http://www.mzptec.com/)** - Applying microfluidics to the development of smart and affordable medical diagnostic tools. The team  developed the “Blood Microviscometer”, a device that analyzes a single drop of blood in just a few minutes and could radically affect the diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions. MZP Tech is  currently running pre-clinical trials in conjunction with two hospitals in Argentina and has attracted a lot of interest from neonatologists, cardiologists and hematologists both in Argentina and the US.

Seeking to move away from standard accelerator models, our aim for the program is to provide a hyper-tailored experience for the companies. The guiding principles for this program are to: Network, Expand and Accelerate. The Networking element is the focal point for this cohort. The strength of our collective community will be the deciding factor in the success of our startups.

The Expand portion of the program aligns the startups with the exponential thinking model at Singularity University. During the first two weeks of the program, we will have expert speakers highlight the impact of up and coming  technological trends affecting our startups. We are optimizing each session for a specific, tangible outcome and have built a workshop model of 1 speaker / 1 outcome. 

During the concurrent 6 weeks, the companies will integrate their learnings into the building phase. We will pull back structured programming and devote individual time for startup development. This will serve the overarching goal to Accelerate our ventures.  

We are thrilled to have amazing companies in our cohort and look forward to a great program!
