---
Singularity University is offering $400,000 in Class B shares through our [Crowdfunder effort](https://www.crowdfunder.com/singularity-university/invest) for SU alumni and our community to co-invest into SU startups leveraging exponential technologies for global impact.  

We have a proven track record in investing in entrepreneurs solving billion person challenges. Our SU LABS Accelerator Seed Fund will invest $100,000 in each of the companies selected for the SU Startup Lab Accelerator Program that starts on September 28. Your investment has the potential to transform billions of lives!

*This opportunity is available ONLY to accredited investors who are U.S. taxpayers.*

For non-accredited investors we offer a unique opportunity to provide funding for our non-profit startups, who will participate in the SU LABS Startup Accelerator. Non-profits will receive $50,000 in the form of a non-restrictive grant. To fund these startups we set up a tax-exempt funding opportunity for you.
