![Let The Planning Begin](/img/blog/2014-12-08.jpg)

Videos, blogs, brain dumps, marinating in research, lists of to-dos, a hint of Pinterest and a whole lot of coffee have led us to the front door of the planning phase!

Nicknamed the "quiet before the storm" this is the time when we take those intangible bursts of inspiration and introduce them to reality. Armed with stickies and some masking tape we are making our first moves toward cultivating the fertile grounds for launching impressive startups into the next phase of funding and R&D. Our sketches show an array of super star guest speakers, technical deep dives, mission dinners, mini-pitch days, protected work time and a dedicated team! Our eyes are set on being [The Best Accelerator](http://startup.singularityu.org/accelerator/) for exponential tech startups addressing [Global Grand Challenges](http://startup.singularityu.org/ggc/).

From here on out the SU Labs' Accelerator team will eat, sleep and breathe our user journey map, best practice interviews, and that little voice that dares us to go the extra mile. 

**Happy disrupting!**
