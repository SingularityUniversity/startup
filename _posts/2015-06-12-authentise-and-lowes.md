Forbes recently [featured the partnership between Authentise and Lowe's](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2015/06/11/authentise-helps-lowes-innovation-labs-build-3d-printing-experience-for-consumers/) as an indication of the future of 3D printing. Through collaboration with the Lowe's Innovation Lab, [Authentise](http://authentise.com/) set up a 3D scanning and printing station in the Mountain View Orchard Hardware Store. The station would allow for customer to have broken/missing/used pieces scanned. They can choose to have it tidied up for 3D printing ($10) or customized ($25) and then printed. The initiative represents a large step in the everyday use of digital fabrication.

The article also touched on the strong relationship between SU LABS and the Lowe's Innovation Lab. Through the SU Corporate Partnership Program, Lowe's has rolled out several exciting initiatives, including the retail-service Oshbot robot from [Fellow Robots](http://fellowrobots.com/) (another SU Company).

We congratulate the Authentise team and look forward to bring more exponential tech to Loweâ€™s!
