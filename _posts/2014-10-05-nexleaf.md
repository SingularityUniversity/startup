title: "SU Company #30: NexLeaf Analytics"
---
We are incredibly happy to announce (somewhat belated) our thirtieth SU Company: [NexLeaf](http://www.nexleaf.org), a Los Angeles based non-profit organization which designs, manufactures and deploys wireless sensors at a fraction of the cost of any competitor; and analyzes and packages the data to make it immediately useful to address big global health and environmental challenges. Currently, NexLeaf's customers are using Nexleaf sensors to ensure vaccines are stored correctly, and to reward rural women who switch over to clean energy technologies with funds from the global carbon credit market.

Studies show that 30% of vaccines administered in the the developing nations spoil due to a break in the cold chain. NexLeaf's connected sensors provide realtime data from each fridge to alarm personnel about a break in the cold chain as well as provide deep insights into usage patterns.

Welcome Team NexLeaf - we can't wait to see what you will do in the coming months and years!
