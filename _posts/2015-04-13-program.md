title: "SU Labs – Startup Accelerator Curriculum"
---
SU Labs’ Startup Accelerator is designed to support companies (both for- and non-profit) leveraging exponential technologies to solve [humanity's grand challenges](http://startup.singularityu.org/ggc/). Whilst designing the program and curriculum we consulted with leading experts (huge kudos and thanks to our friends at Matter.VC and the Unreasonable Institute) to ensure we deliver not only a unique and incredibly valuable program, but also strike the right balance between learning and building.

The ten-week program is divided into three main parts:

<!--break-->

* Week 1 is Bootcamp Week. Here we'll take you through a series of workshops, sessions and exercises to set you and your company up for success.
* Weeks 2 - 9 are divided into four themed two-week long sprints. Each sprint concludes with a Design Review where you will pitch your startup to a group of experts to get feedback in a safe, open environment.
* Week 10 is Demo Day Week. This week we will have all-hands-on-deck to get you ready for the big demo day where you will pitch in front of Silicon Valley's top investors and corporate partners.

The core 8-weeks alternate between Week One and Two schedules.

Mondays, Tuesdays, and Friday mornings are optimized for teams to shape their own schedule with off-site meetings and or working hours; we'll offer office hours and co-working space. On Wednesdays we'll host an accomplished mentor who will spend a significant part of the day with us (leaving ample time for 1:1s during Week Ones).

On Week Two Schedule there will be mini-pitch reviews, where we encourage experimenting with the pitch approach in a safe environment and the chance to socialize with the guest panelists during the social mixer afterward. Thursdays the cohort divides into two peer-run Deep Dive sessions. Then the Rapid Prototyping Shareouts reinforces the fast approach to problem solving that is vital to the success of startups. On Friday afternoons the teams will be guided through leadership development and host a guest during topical Global Grand Challenge dinners. As you can see on the agenda - we have regular social events on the agenda as well as large blocks of time which a reserved for building your product or service.
