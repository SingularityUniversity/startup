We've been working on this for a little while - now it's finally here: Singularity University's inaugural [Startup Accelerator](http://startup.singularityu.org/accelerator/) is coming in mid-March 2015 and [applications are now open](http://startup.singularityu.org/accelerator/apply.html)!

We are incredibly excited about opening the doors to the first accelerator program specifically built for startups tackling [humanity’s grand challenges](http://startup.singularityu.org/ggc/) leveraging exponential technology at scale.

<!--break-->

In an intense hands-on **10-week experience** on the Singularity University campus in the heart of Silicon Valley we will take startups from prototype or early proof-of-concept to scale. Starting with a **one-week Bootcamp experience**, the SU Startup Lab Accelerator team will guide you through **four two-week long sprints**, each focused on a different area of your business.

At each step along the way you will receive **guidance, advice and feedback** from some of the most accomplished experts in their respective fields, **plug into Singularity University’s programs and initiatives** and **meet with our Impact Partners and Fortune 500 companies**. Weekly speaker series, share-outs and review session round up the overall experience.

We provide investment to give you runway throughout the program, a co-working space at NASA Research Park, a structured program offering and the best Singularity University has to offer – all with the goal to help you build products positively impacting humanity at scale.
