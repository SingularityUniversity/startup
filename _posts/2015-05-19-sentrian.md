Sentrian aspires to eliminate all preventable hospitalization by leveraging the revolution in remote biosensors and machine learning to remotely and accurately detect patient deterioration. 

This news comes at the heels of Caremore Health Systems, a subsidiary of Anthem Blue Cross, picking Sentrian as a remote monitoring solution for patients living with complex chronic diseases. 

Congrats to the Sentrian team; keep up the great work!
