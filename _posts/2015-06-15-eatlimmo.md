EatLimmo has developed a process that uses the most nutritious parts of fruitsâ€”mango peels and avocado seeds-which are typically discarded.  It transforms these waste products into highly nutritional, functional, and inexpensive ingredients for the food- processing industry. The nutrient (Limmo) is used as a substitute for fat, sugar, and other unhealthy baking inputs. 

Products made with Limmo taste and look identical to traditional baking methods. Based in Mexico, the team is tackling the problem of unhealthy processed foods. Mexico currently leads the Western Hemisphere in obesity rates. Diabetes, a complication associated with obesity, is the number one killer for Mexican citizens. 

SU Labs is proud to have EatLimmo and we look forward to their bright future.
