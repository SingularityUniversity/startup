With Spring in the air, SU Labs hosted our Companies mixer to engage with our community and debut [Semtive](http://semtive.com/en/home), our newest SU Company. Event attendees included: SU mentors, local entrepreneurs, and staff from Bayer, a recent Corporate Program Partner.

The night started off with a panel discussion from Jonathan Nelson, the founder of Hackers and Founders. Jonathan covered various topics from: cultural challenges faced by international entrepreneurs, proper structuring of funding, and the tech proliferation in the developing world. Our international audience (including Argentine, Canadian, German, Italian, and Russian attendees) listened with rapt attention.

Following the panel, SU companies Semtive and [Solvy](http://solvy.com/) (mobile ed-tech for math) spoke about their developments and involvement with SU. The ventures engaged with the audience to share their vision for crushing Global Grand Challenges. Following their speech, our mentor Florian Kolb from RWE, Germanyâ€™s largest utility company, took stage to talk about his outlook on the coming energy trends. 

The night ended with mingling and sharing of crazy ideas about the future. Looking forward to having you at the next one!
