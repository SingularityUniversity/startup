title: Nexleaf in Fast Forward Accelerator
---
We are thrilled to announce that [Nexleaf Analytics](http://nexleaf.org/) will be joining the [Fast Forward Accelerator](https://www.ffwd.org/) for non-profit companies. Nexleaf manufactures and deploys wireless sensors to ensure vaccines donâ€™t spoil during storage or transport. By leveraging the global network of cell phones coupled with low-cost sensors, they allow public health organizations with limited resources to achieve large-scale impact.

The Fast Forward Accelerator unlocks the power of the tech community to tackle social issues. From poverty, to education access, to improving health, to environmental degradation. Seeing an industry gap in supporting tech nonprofits, Fast Forward provides financial and human capital to help scale these technology solutions and maximize impact.
 
We are very excited for the Nexleaf team; keep up the great work!
