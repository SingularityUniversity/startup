Singularity University Labs' portfolio company [Made In Space](http://madeinspace.us/) is about to launch the first 3D printer which works in microgravity into space - and you can be part of this historic event!

Head over to the [#BeamItUp](http://madeinspace.us/beamitup/) campaign page and submit your idea for an item which could be printed on the International Space Station.

And tune in for the launch of Space X's CRS-4 mission which will bring Made In Space's 3D printer to the ISS.

Godspeed Team Made In Space!
