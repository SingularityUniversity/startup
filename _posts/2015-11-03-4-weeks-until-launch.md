Daylight savings. An extra hour worth of incentive to get up early, stare down your inbox and move your product forward. Our startups took the extra time and devoted it to their pitch training.

Our companies are lucky to be coached by Bill Joos of Go To Market Consulting. Bill spent over seven years as the VP of Entrepreneur Development at Garage Technology Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm that he helped co-found with startup guru/author Guy Kawasaki.

The presentations have come a tremendously long way thanks to Billâ€™s guidance. He has taken them through the entire pitch journey from the handshake pitch (what you say after saying hello) to the napkin pitch (conceptualizing your mission) to the proper on stage presentation. Our entrepreneurs have refined their message all while working on product and funding developments. They are excited to spread their message with the world on 12/5!
