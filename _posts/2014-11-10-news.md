Dear SU LABS Community,

First of all â€“ welcome to our shiny new website. We hope you like it! Other than launching our new website, preparing our inaugural [accelerator class](http://startup.singularityu.org/accelerator/) (coming in March 2015 - register now to be informed when applications open) and launching SU LABS' [Entrepreneur in Residence program](http://startup.singularityu.org/accelerator/) a lot more has happened:

<!--break-->

- [Fellow Robots](http://fellowrobots.com/) launched the [OSHBot](http://fellowrobots.com/robots) together with Lowe's, reinventing retail. John Oliver couldn't resist and brought the OSHBot to "Last Week Tonight" ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boI4D1FlIVs)).
- [Matternet](http://matternet.us/) had a wonderful [write-up](http://www.businessinsider.com/matternet-uav-delivery-drones-2014-11) on Business Insider.
- We travelled to Buenos Aires to talk about entrepreneurship at the [InnovatiBA](http://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/innovatiba) event ([here's our deck](https://speakerdeck.com/pfinette/singularity-university-on-entrepreneurship)).
