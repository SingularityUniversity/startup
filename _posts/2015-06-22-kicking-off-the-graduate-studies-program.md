title: Kicking Off The Graduate Studies Program
---
We are **extremely** excited to kick off our 2015 Graduate Studies Program (GSP). Out of hundreds of applicants, Singularity University chose 80 finalists to attend the 10 week long experience. The GSP participants will spend the first five weeks in intensive learning modules, where our faculty will teach them about exponential tech. The curriculum will feature prominent speakers such as Guy Kawasaki (Appleâ€™s first chief evangelist) and Tom Chi (creator of Google Glass).

The participants will spend the following five weeks pairing off into groups in the team project phase. This time will be focused to building a product which uses exponential tech to address a Global Grand Challenge. Companies such as [Matternet](http://mttr.net) and [Made in Space](http://madeinspace.us) were built in previous GSP programs. 

Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus kicked off the GSP festivities with a rousing speech about the power of socially geared development. He spoke of his journey in establishing the Grameen Bank (and pioneering micro financing), developing the Grameen phone (mobile for the rural poor) and curing night blindness among children in Bangladesh. Mr. Yunus spoke about the transformative power of technology and encouraged the GSP 15 class to develop projects with a billion people in mind. We are incredibly grateful to Mr. Yunus for making the time to speak to our GSP class and are excited for the coming weeks ahead!
