title: "Singularity University Accelerator: Weeks 3-5 Recap"
---
With the SU Labs Accelerator rounding week 8, we wanted to fill you in on the mid-program learnings during weeks 3-5. 

<!-- break -->

Following our Bootcamp and Prototyping focused weeks, our startups dug into baseline necessities for scaling up their companies. Week 3 focused on developing financial and team building acumen. Our startups heard from Jim Cook, CFO of Mozilla and co-founder of Netflix about Financial Structuring. The participants later heard from a panel of VCs about vetting and evaluation.  

To bolster team cohesion we hosted Gayle Young, former Chief Culture and Talent Officer at Wikimedia, to speak to our companies on co-founder dynamic and team-building.  

We spent week 4 on developing sales and marketing best practices. We hosted Tracy Demiroz (early stage/stealth marketing expert) for one-on-one deep dives with companies. Later in the week Tim Chou, one of the pioneers of Cloud based services, spoke on the trick to quickly closing enterprise sales. 

To bookend the weeks, we hosted Salim Ismael, author of Exponential Organizations (Frost & Sullivan 2014 Innovation Book of the Year) for an intimate dinner. Salim spoke about the exponential technologies which are closest to disrupting major industries.
