## About

Imagine never having to draw blood, puncture the skin, or cause pain again so you or your doctor can access your biological data. LivSpek is developing the first non invasive, real time, digital, handheld, blood analysis device. Using a spectrometer directed at the eye, LivSpek will detect the concentrations of blood borne components while replacing invasive, lab intensive blood tests and providing early detection of disease by monitoring biomarkers.
