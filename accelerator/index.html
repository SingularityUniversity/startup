			<h3>The Program</h3>
			<p>In an intense hands-on <strong class="highlight">8-week experience</strong> on the Singularity University campus in the heart of Silicon Valley we will take startups from prototype or early proof-of-concept to scale. Starting with a one-week <strong class="highlight">Exponential Thinking Bootcamp</strong>, we will guide you through <strong class="highlight">four intense weeks of accelerated learning</strong>; covering topics ranging from future forecasting, rapid prototyping, business fundamentals to fundraising. This is followed by four weeks of time to integrate what you learned and build your product. The program will be capped off by our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz-xaNyC9s_ra_zUuZBXjPM9HfAmJNlje">Demo Night event</a>.</p>
			<p>Our unique global educational position provides fertile grounds for startups to <strong class="highlight">connect with leaders on business, leadership, product, and marketing development</strong>. We combine the best that SU has to offer, by giving you <strong class="highlight">unparalleled access</strong> to an invested community made up of <strong class="highlight">Fortune 500 companies</strong> in our overbooked Corporate Executive Program, <strong class="highlight">thought leaders</strong> enrolled in our Google-sponsored Global Solutions Program, <strong class="highlight">alumni</strong> in our international network hubs, and <strong class="highlight">accomplished attendees</strong> of the X-Prize/SU/Deloitte joint effort, the Innovation Partnership Program.</p>
			<p>We provide <strong class="highlight">$100,000 in seed funding</strong> to give you runway throughout the program, a co-working space at NASA Research Park, a structured program offering and the best Singularity University has to offer for 7-10% equity in your company.
