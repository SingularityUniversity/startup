<h4>What kind of startups is the Accelerator looking for?</h4>

<p>Startups leveraging exponential technologies to tackle Global Grand Challenges (<a href="http://singularityu.org/global-grand-challenges/">GGC</a>). </p>

<p>A team that is passionate about solving intractable global problems in the fields such as food security, governance, healthcare, poverty, security, and water (among others).
Demonstrable use of one or more exponential technologies- AI, robotics, synthetic biology, nanotech and more (see Q2). </p>

<p>Your team has strong tech expertise, relevant background in the problem space, and a deep dedication to your solution. </p>

<p>We are looking for startups who have demonstrated traction to prove that their  company offers a real solution to the problem. Traction comes in many forms and good indicators are:</p>

<ul>
<li>People are willing to pay for your solution</li>
<li>You have solid research or expertise around the problem</li>
<li>You’ve signed LOI/LOA with companies wanting to integrate your technology</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>What are exponential technologies?</h4>

<p>Exponential technologies include emerging tech in the fields of: artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing (3D printing), synthetic biology, clean energy, medical devices/services, robotics, etc. </p>

<p>These are technologies which are growing at an exponential rate by typically lowering in cost while increasing in performance. A good example of this is outlined in Moore’s Law, which states that computing power doubles every 24 months while decreasing in cost by half. </p>

<p>Other examples are how technologies such as 3D printing, drones, and robotics are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in society. These technologies were inaccessible 10 years ago and used exclusively in government, large industrial, and research applications. Today, a six year old can print a replacement part for a flying robot in their own home. </p>

<p>The same holds true for biotech and medical devices. For example the cost of genome  sequencing has dropped exponentially, allowing startups to enter into personalized genomics. Similarly the cost of developing medical devices has been steadily decreasing while hardware is getting more sophisticated. </p>

<p>Lastly exponential technologies include tech which is spreading at an exponential rate to provide services to needy populations around the world. A great example of this is how mobile proliferation in the developing world has allowed the most disenfranchised populations internet access, which brings access to banking, healthcare and information.</p>

<hr>

<h4>What are the requirements for startups to be accepted?</h4>

<p>Besides being a mission fit (using exponential technologies to solve GGCs) startups need:</p>

<ul>
<li>To have a minimum of two full time co-founders to attend the program. </li>
<li>US incorporated. </li>
<li>A GGC fit – Product/Service has the clear potential to  measurably improve one of the Global Grand Challenge areas.</li>
<li>Exponential Technology fit – Product/Service leverages one or more exponential technologies</li>
<li>Market Opportunity (for-profit): Long-term market opportunity in the $billions with near term market opportunity in the tens of millions.  </li>
<li>Expertise &amp; Team-Fit: Team has experience working together and has specific domain expertise in the industry they are building</li>
<li>Product Market Fit – Company can demonstrate product/market fit through traction and achieved milestones</li>
<li>Strategic Capacity – A plan that clearly articulates the company’s values, strategy, and plan to attract the required capital and partnerships    </li>
<li>Clear 6 month road map</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why is 2 co-founders important?</h4>

<p>Two co-founders ensures that your company’s development during the program will translate after graduation. We do not accept solo founders. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Why does my company have to be incorporated in the US?</h4>

<p>Your business can be based anywhere, however if you are not incorporated in the US we can not invest money into your company (nor can a VC in the United States). For relatively quick incorporation, our previous companies have used the Delaware C Corp structure. We recommend speaking with your lawyer about the best way to incorporate as we can’t offer legal counsel. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Does my business have to be based in the US?</h4>

<p>No but see question above.</p>

<hr>

<h4>What are the goals of the SU Accelerator?</h4>

<p>The mission of our program is to: Network, Expand, and Accelerate you. </p>

<p>Our primary goal is to Network you with an unparalleled set of advisors, corporate contacts, mentors, funders, and plug you into the worldwide SU community. </p>

<p>Among a host of notable achievements, our <a href="http://startup.singularityu.org/mentor/">mentors</a> have: developed the first prototype of Google glass, designed the UX for the Big Dog robot, and funded over thirty medtech companies with a cumulative market cap over $50 billion. </p>

<p>In addition to networking, we will provide you with business and technology experts who will Expand your thinking. This expansion phase will have you optimize and re-design aspects of your business for long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>The overall goal is to Accelerate the growth of your company. Think of the program as a pressure cooker for high speed development. Each week you’ll be meeting with advisors, refining your offering, and testing validation with customers to move your product forward. </p>

<hr>

<h4>How much equity does SU take? What comes with it?</h4>

<p>For participation in the program, we take 7% equity. In addition, we will provide \(100K convertible note with 20% discount at a \)3M market cap (separate to the 7%). For this you will get:</p>

<ol>
<li>All the programming during the 8 week Accelerator. This includes custom tailored  mentor matches, introductions to investors, pitch training, exposure to proprietary SU curriculum, media assets, personalized Accelerator board of advisors, Mastermind Sessions, introductions to our corporate network, among other perks.</li>
<li>After the program, you will get automatically enrolled in our SU Startup Network, which is a dedicated long-term support program. The Startup Network will provide access to our funders, mentors, <a href="http://singularityu.org/non-profits/">development organizations</a>, AWS and Google Cloud credits, media support, speaking opportunities at our sold-out industry <a href="http://exponential.singularityu.org/">conferences</a>, <a href="http://singularityu.org/labs/corporate/">corporate partners</a> and more.</li>
<li>Featured a Singularity Startup to our expanding global community.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h4>What are the dates for the program?</h4>

<p>Our Winter program is scheduled to kick off in February and will run for 8 weeks. Dates will be February 6th to March 27th.  </p>

<p>Our applications will open in September and we will have our full class selected by mid December. </p>

<hr>

<h4>What will my day to day look like?</h4>

<p>The days will be a mix of programming in the morning (workshops given by our speakers) as well as occasional evening events (dinner with cohort + meeting with mentors). </p>

<p>Overall we aim to keep programming light so you can go out and do the work to move your product forward. During the first few weeks we will have more programmed touch points with the entire class. As the program continues, we will shift to more customized engagements with each team. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Where will the program take place? Can I be remote?</h4>

<p>The program will take place at our campus on NASA Research Park Facility in Mountain View, CA. Mountain View is in the heart of Silicon Valley and is within easy traveling distance to San Francisco, Palo Alto, Oakland and other Bay Area locations. </p>

<p>Due to the intense nature of the program, we require you and your co-founder to attend in person. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Will you be providing lodging/food/travel?</h4>

<p>We will connect you with lodging sources on campus but will not be providing you with lodging. If you’d like to live off-campus, Craigslist is a good place to search for short term housing. </p>

<p>We will be providing food when we have programming during the Accelerator (few times a week). Otherwise there are plenty of places nearby to eat or order food for delivery. </p>

<p>We will be happy to provide you with a visa letter but will not be paying for travel. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Is there a monetary cost to attend the program?</h4>

<p>There is no monetary cost to attend, the program will be fully covered by the deal terms of the investment. You will be responsible for travel and living expenses. </p>

<hr>

<h4>How will we know if we’ve succeeded?</h4>

<p>Prior to arriving at the Accelerator, our team will work with you determine your metrics for success. We will use these metrics to have you evaluate your progress during the program and focus our collective efforts to making them successful. </p>

<p>In addition our team will be checking in with you during the program to help navigate you towards success. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Can I apply after the deadline?</h4>

<p>Our deadlines are concrete, so once they close we can’t accept any more applicants. That being said, we will be running another Accelerator in the Fall (dates TBA), so if you miss this deadline or think your team needs more time to refine your product, apply to our next cohort.</p>
