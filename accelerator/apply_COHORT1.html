			<h4>Requirements</h4>
			<p>The SU Startup Accelerator supports early-stage entrepreneurs leveraging exponential technology at scale to address one of <a href="/ggc/">humanity's grand challenges</a>.</p>
			<p>Our target ventures are existing teams of at least <span class="highlight">2 co-founders</span> with skill sets covering technology, business, design, prototyping and impact/social entrepreneurship. They are pursuing a <span class="highlight">sustainable, scalable, for- or non-profit business strategy</span> and have built an <span class="highlight">early stage prototype</span> of their product or service.</p>
			<p>One to two co-founders must <span class="highlight">work full-time out of the SU LABS space</span> in Mountain View, CA for the full 10 weeks of the program and attend the kick-off bootcamp and retreat, weekly speaker series and share-outs, and monthly design reviews. Please note that it is your responsibility to make sure you can participate in our program in person; we can not help you with any visa-related questions or issues.</p>
			<p>We provide <span class="highlight">dedicated support services, community, space, and funding</span> to our accelerator companies. Our investment stake will depend on the stage and structure of your company and will be in the typical accelerator range. For non-profit organizations we provide funding in the form of an unrestricted grant.</p>
			<h4>Timeline</h4>
			<p>Our current target is to launch the inaugural class of the Startup Accelerator on <strong class="highlight">March 23rd, 2015</strong>. We will close applications on <strong class="highlight">January 23rd, 2015</strong> and let the selected teams know about their participation on <strong class="highlight">February 14th, 2015</strong>. However, the timing is subject to change. Our focus is assembling the best, most complementary cohort of start-ups, providing value to all applicants throughout the process through establishing early relationships, and launching the cohort once a solid class forms.</p>
