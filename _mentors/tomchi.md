Tom has worked in a wide range of disciplines from astrophysical research to F500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He's worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo Answers from 0 to 90 million users).

Tom has pioneered and practiced a unique approach to rapid prototyping, visioning, and data-driven design that has allowed him to both get new things off the ground (Google Glass) and move large organizations at unprecedented speeds.
