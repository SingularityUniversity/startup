Kevin is interested in finding great companies and helping them to grow and make an impact. Since joining WIN as the first full-time hire in 2010, He has worn many hats, including helping to source & evaluate deals, regularly checking in with portfolio companies to see how Win can be of help, working with an incredible network of Affiliates, designing and running several all-Network events, including two 120 person+ internal Summits, product managing two internal websites, and (of course) trying to keep up with email.

Kevin gets excited about technology that genuinely makes people's lives better--marketplaces and service-oriented businesses to give people better control over their time and resources, smart enterprise software that lets people be more efficient and happy, connected devices that make meaningful differences in people's lives. Apart from ventures, he loves silly projects, movies, evolutionary biology, and walking as much as he can.
