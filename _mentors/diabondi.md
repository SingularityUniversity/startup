Dia spent over a decade in storytelling. First helping people do it, now in helping brands do it. She's worked developing training curriculum for storytelling, executive coaching for the stage for technology leaders and leaders for the winning Rio2016 Olympic Bid and Clinton Global Initiative. 

She currently serves as an Executive Producer of Creative Marketing and Consumer Marketing at Twitter. Formerly she worked to craft narratives for the Mozilla Project. At Mozilla she worked in Brand Engagement on all things story. Through narrative experiences, she is scaling the intimate model of one voice at a time to impact the project and the humans in it or touched by it.

No matter the topic or territory, Dia listens and extracts the ONE most important idea and anchors a story with it. Plus, she's fun and genuinely loves people and their potential.
