Lucas Nelson is a Principal at Gotham Ventures and is a proud geek; a hacker turned VC. Lucas brings a unique mix of technical depth and business knowledge to bear when Gotham Ventures works with a company.  He is most excited by companies that are trying to use technology to make a dent in the universe.

Lucas works most closely with Gotham Ventures Portfolio companies STELLAService and ADstruc as well as his angel investments in Branch, DarkNet, and WayWire. He is a Kauffman Fellow, co-authored The Art of Software Security Testing, chaired DefCon – the largest hacking convention in the US – for 10 years, and has been a member of the NY tech community since 1999.

After working in operating and investing roles on the West Coast, Lucas was recruited back east to join Gotham Ventures and participate in the burgeoning startup ecosystem of New York. Prior to this he was a Senior Manager for Product Security at Adobe, where he worked to develop the strategy and led the execution for Adobe’s proactive security solutions as part of their secure development lifecycle. While in Silicon Valley he also worked as an Investment Associate at US Venture Partners where he focused on deal sourcing and due diligence in cloud computing and security companies. Lucas first got involved in the New York startup community as a programmer in 1999 and worked for three startups: i33, FlashBase and @Stake, which were all successfully acquired.

Lucas received a B.S. in computer science from Purdue University and an MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. Lucas is on the NJ EDC Venture Advisory Board and the Board of Directors of Health Assessment Labs, an organization whose goal to advance the state-of-the-art tools for monitoring health care services and health outcomes from the patient/consumer point of view. He practices the martial arts of Capoeira and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and is a Scotch connoisseur.  Lucas also attends hackathons and still codes a bit in his spare time.
