Allen Taylor has built his whole career in private-sector-focused economic development. Allen is a big believer in the power of entrepreneurs to change the world -- and great investors to help them do it! Allen runs Endeavor's San Francisco office, where he connects a portfolio of 600+ high-growth companies with US-based mentors and investors.

He oversees the Endeavor Investor Network – a program designed to connect venture capital and growth equity investors with high-impact entrepreneurs and local investment partners across Latin America, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. In the past few years, Endeavor companies raised more than $500M in equity capital.

Allen is also a Managing Director of Endeavor Catalyst, an innovative co-investment vehicle through which Endeavor can invest into its portfolio companies. Launched in January 2012, Endeavor Catalyst has made 19 investments to date across seven different emerging markets (as of Dec 2014), including Globant (GLOB) in Argentina, Yemeksepeti.com in Turkey and Bebê Store in Brazil.
