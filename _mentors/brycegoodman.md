Bryce is a recognized advocate of sustainable innovation, and has spoken at numerous venues including the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS), Institute for Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) and the International Electronics Recycling Congress (IERC). In addition, Bryce serves on the advisory board of the Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition (SVTC), the oldest NGO working to ensure environmental sustainability and social justice in the high tech sector. Immediately prior to BlueOak, Bryce conducted analysis on rare earth and technology metals for Mitsubishi UFJ, a Japanese investment bank. Bryce is a graduate of Deep Springs College and Singularity University, and holds a first class degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford.

Electronic waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the world. Bryce's "urban mining" business, BlueOak Resources, is hoping to alleviate this wastefulness by converting the e-waste of today into a source of critical metals and rare earths for the technologies of tomorrow. Bryce is a former precious metals commodity.
