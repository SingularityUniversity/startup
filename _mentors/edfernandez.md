Ed is a seasoned mobile industry veteran with more than two decades of experience combined. Member of the Young Presidents' Organization, a worldwide non for profit association of leaders and entrepreneurs under 45.

He is Partner & Co-founder of Naiss.io, a venture capital boutique in Palo Alto, focusing on technology based start ups and early stage companies, preparing them for M&A and IPO in alternative markets.

As a VC practitioner he started in 2012 as investor and venture partner in a $10MM Start Up venture fund with 12 companies in portfolio. He is board observer & advisor to some of them.

Ed's first computer was a Commodore 64 back in the 80s, a 64Kb RAM machine running on a 1 MHz CPU. Avid assembler programmer he became an amateur hacker at that time.

Ed lives in Palo Alto with his family. He is mission driven, and a parallel multitasker with nerd traits: curious, ENTP, self-made, resilient, highly functional and finisher of Madrid's marathon (all an euphemism for modern ADHD).
