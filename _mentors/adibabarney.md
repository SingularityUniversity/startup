Adiba Barney is the CEO of SVForum - Silicon Valley´s largest and oldest non-profit organization, dedicated to educating and creating relationships within the technology and startup community. She was prior to that the Executive Director of Silicon Vikings, a non-profit business networking organization connecting the Nordic´s innovation and startup ecosystem to Silicon Valley. Prior to Silicon Vikings, Adiba initiated, developed, and launched Innovative Sweden, a world tour exhibition promoting Sweden as an innovative country by showcasing a new generation of Swedish innovations. That is what brought her from Sweden to Silicon Valley in early 2011.

Prior to the Innovative Sweden project, Adiba worked for 13 years within the Swedish innovation ecosystem (science parks, incubators, regional and government development agencies) where she focused on creating sustainable networking platforms, developing/executing high-profile PR projects, and coaching hundreds of startup entrepreneurs in international marketing, business development, market entry, communication, PR and branding.
