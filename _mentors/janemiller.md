Jane is the founder of a career advice website, Janeknows.com, and the author of Sleep Your Way to the Top (and other myths about business success) which was published by FGPress in May 2014.  She is deeply engaged as a mentor at the University of Colorado and with the Blackstone Entrepreneurial Network. She serves as a board member at the Leeds Business School at the University of Colorado-Boulder and is co-teaching a business class there in the Spring 2015 semester.  She is also a board member at the Unreasonable Institute, Justin’s Nut Butter, Natural Foodworks Group, Eldorado Springs Artesian Water, Madhava Sweeteners and Rework.  Her involvement as a mentor for young professionals and start-ups resulted in her being named the Lifetime Achievement Award Winner for the Denver Business Journal in 2013.

Most recently, she was the CEO and president of Charter Baking Company, a private-equity backed rollup of organic and natural bakeries.  Hired to turn around the performance of the business, she divested an unprofitable division and doubled the sales and profitability of the premier brand, Rudi’s Organic.  That division was successfully sold to Hain-Celestial Group in April 2014.

Prior to Charter, Jane was part of an executive team that brought Hostess out of bankruptcy, was the president of HJHeinz in London, and ran the Western division of Bestfoods Baking (Oroweat, Thomas English Muffins, Brownberry and Entenmann’s).  She spent fourteen years at PepsiCo, rising to be the President of the Central division of Frito-Lay.

Jane has a Russian Studies degree from Knox College in Galesburg, IL and an MBA
from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX.
