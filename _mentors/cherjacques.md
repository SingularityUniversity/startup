Cher Jacques has over 10 years of experience in international development, impact investing and social entrepreneurship. As the Africa Regional Director for Kiva, Cher is responsible for establishing regional strategy and overseeing the portfolio of investments across the areas of financial access, clean energy, education, water/sanitation, mobile money and agriculture. Cher has worked in financial access with the Grameen Foundation, honing strategy to support their rural outreach efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa. She managed the development and opening of a bank branch in the Democratic Republic of Congo for FINCA International, where she was responsible for all initial operations, strategic planning and expansion, and managing the loan portfolio. She spent several years as a consultant with Spitfire Strategies, working to build the strategic communications capacity of nonprofit organizations. Most recently she oversaw all financial and grant-making operations for the international work of the Institute for Sustainable Communities.

Cher sits on the board of African Entrepreneur Collective, a collection of business accelerators supporting local entrepreneurs across Africa. She has a BA in Political Science and International Studies from Wake Forest University and an MBA from Yale School of Management and is fluent in French. A California native, Cher loves running, cooking veggie meals, dancing to 90's music, yoga and pottery (though she can really only make lopsided bowls).
